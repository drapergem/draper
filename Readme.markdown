# Draper: View Models for Rails

[![TravisCI Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jcasimir/draper.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jcasimir/draper)
[![Gemnasium Build Status](https://gemnasium.com/jcasimir/draper.png)](https://gemnasium.com/jcasimir/draper)

## Quick Start

1. Add `gem 'draper'` to your `Gemfile` and `bundle`
2. Run `rails g draper:install` to create the directory and `ApplicationDecorator`
3. Run `rails g draper:decorator YourModel`
4. Edit `app/decorators/[your_model]_decorator.rb` using:
  1. `h` to proxy to Rails/application helpers like `h.current_user`
  2. `[your_model]` to access the wrapped object like `article.created_at`
5. Put common decorations in `app/decorators/application.rb`  
6. Wrap models in your controller with the decorator using:
  1. `.find` automatic lookup & wrap
    ex: `ArticleDecorator.find(1)`
  2. `.decorate` method with single object or collection, 
    ex: `ArticleDecorator.decorate(Article.all)`
  3. `.new` method with single object
    ex: `ArticleDecorator.new(Article.first)`
7. Output the instance methods in your view templates
  ex: `@article_decorator.created_at`

## Goals

This gem makes it easy to apply the decorator pattern to domain models in a Rails application. This pattern gives you three wins:

1. Replace most helpers with an object-oriented approach
2. Filter data at the presentation level
3. Enforce an interface between your controllers and view templates.

### 1. Object Oriented Helpers

Why hate normal helpers? In Ruby/Rails we approach everything from an Object-Oriented perspective, then with helpers we get procedural.The job of a helper is to take in data and output a presentation-ready string. We can do that with a decorator.

A decorator wraps an object with presentation-related accessor methods. For instance, if you had an `Article` object, then the decorator could override `.published_at` to use formatted output like this:

```ruby
class ArticleDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :article
  def published_at
    date = h.content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%A, %B %e").squeeze(" "), :class => 'date')
    time = h.content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%l:%M%p"), :class => 'time').delete(" ")
    h.content_tag :span, date + time, :class => 'created_at'
  end
end
```

### 2. View-Layer Data Filtering

Have you ever written a `to_xml` or `to_json` method in your model? Did it feel weird to put presentation logic in your model?

Or, in the course of formatting this data, did you wish you could access `current_user` down in the model? Maybe for guests your `to_json` is only going to show three attributes, but if the user is an admin they get to see them all.

How would you handle this in the model layer? You'd probably pass the `current_user` or some role/flag down to `to_json`. That should still feel slimy.

When you use a decorator you have the power of a Ruby object but it's a part of the view layer. This is where your `to_json` belongs. You can access your `current_user` helper method using the `h` proxy available in the decorator:

```ruby
class ArticleDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :article
  ADMIN_VISIBLE_ATTRIBUTES = [:title, :body, :author, :status]
  PUBLIC_VISIBLE_ATTRIBUTES = [:title, :body]

  def to_json
    attr_set = h.current_user.admin? ? ADMIN_VISIBLE_ATTRIBUTES : PUBLIC_VISIBLE_ATTRIBUTES
    article.to_json(:only => attr_set)
  end
end
```

### 3. Enforcing an Interface

Want to strictly control what methods are proxied to the original object? Use `denies` or `allows`.

#### Using `denies`

The `denies` method takes a blacklist approach. For instance:

```ruby
class ArticleDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :article
  denies :title
end
```

Then, to test it:

```irb
 > ad = ArticleDecorator.find(1)
 => #<ArticleDecorator:0x000001020d7728 @model=#<Article id: 1, title: "Hello, World">> 
 > ad.title
NoMethodError: undefined method `title' for #<ArticleDecorator:0x000001020d7728>
``` 

#### Using `allows`

A better approach is to define a whitelist using `allows`:

```ruby
class ArticleDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :article
  allows :title, :description
end
```

```irb
> ad = ArticleDecorator.find(1)
=> #<ArticleDecorator:0x000001020d7728 @model=#<Article id: 1, title: "Hello, World">> 
> ad.title
=> "Hello, World"
> ad.created_at
NoMethodError: undefined method `created_at' for #<ArticleDecorator:0x000001020d7728>
```

## Up and Running

### Setup

Add the dependency to your `Gemfile`:

```
gem "draper"
```

Then run `bundle` from the project directory.

### Run the draper:install command

This will create the `app/decorators` directory and the `ApplicationDecorator` inside it.

```
rails generate draper:install
```

### Generate the Decorator

To decorate a model named `Article`:

```
rails generate draper:decorator Article
```

### Writing Methods

Open the decorator model (ex: `app/decorators/article_decorator.rb`) and add normal instance methods. To access the wrapped source object, use a method named after the `decorates` argument:

```ruby
class ArticleDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :article
  
  def author_name
    article.author.first_name + " " + article.author.last_name
  end
end
```

### Using Existing Helpers

You probably want to make use of Rails helpers and those defined in your application. Use the `helpers` or `h` method proxy:

```ruby
class ArticleDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :article
  
  def published_at
    date = h.content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%A, %B %e").squeeze(" "), :class => 'date')
    time = h.content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%l:%M%p"), :class => 'time').delete(" ")
    h.content_tag :span, date + time, :class => 'created_at'
  end
end
```

#### Lazy Helpers

Hate seeing that `h.` proxy all over? Willing to mix a bazillion methods into your decorator? Then try lazy helpers:

```ruby
class ArticleDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :article
  include Draper::LazyHelpers
  
  def published_at
    date = content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%A, %B %e").squeeze(" "), :class => 'date')
    time = content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%l:%M%p"), :class => 'time').delete(" ")
    content_tag :span, date + time, :class => 'created_at'
  end
end
```

### In the Controller

When writing your controller actions, you have three options:

* Call `.new` and pass in the object to be wrapped

```ruby
ArticleDecorator.new(Article.find(params[:id]))
```

* Call `.decorate` and pass in an object or collection of objects to be wrapped:

```ruby
ArticleDecorator.decorate(Article.first) # Returns one instance of ArticleDecorator
ArticleDecorator.decorate(Article.all)   # Returns an enumeration proxy of ArticleDecorator instances
```
  
* Call `.find` to automatically do a lookup on the `decorates` class:

```ruby
ArticleDecorator.find(1)
```
  
### In Your Views

Use the new methods in your views like any other model method (ex: `@article.published_at`):

```erb
<h1><%= @article.title %> <%= @article.published_at %></h1>
```

### Using in Mailers

To use decorators in mailers that use helpers, you have to call `set_current_view_context` in your
ActionMailer class.

```ruby
class ArticleMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default 'init-draper' => Proc.new { set_current_view_context }
end
```
### Integration with RSpec

Using the provided generator, Draper will place specs for your new decorator in `spec/decorators/`. 

By default, specs in `spec/decorators` will be tagged as `type => :decorator`. Any spec tagged as `decorator` will run `ApplicationController.new.set_current_view_context` which makes helpers available to the decorator.

If your decorator specs live somewhere else, which they shouldn't, make sure to tag them with `type => :decorator`. If you don't tag them, Draper's helpers won't be available to your decorator while testing. 

Note: If you're using Spork, you need to `require 'draper/rspec_integration'` in your Spork.prefork block.

## Possible Decoration Methods

Here are some ideas of what you might do in decorator methods:

* Implement output formatting for `to_csv`, `to_json`, or `to_xml`
* Format dates and times using `strftime`
* Implement a commonly used representation of the data object like a `.name` method that combines `first_name` and `last_name` attributes

## Example Using a Decorator

For a brief tutorial with sample project, check this out: http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/decorators.html

Say I have a publishing system with `Article` resources. My designer decides that whenever we print the `published_at` timestamp, it should be constructed like this:

```html
<span class='published_at'>
  <span class='date'>Monday, May 6</span>
  <span class='time'>8:52AM</span>
</span>
```

Could we build that using a partial? Yes. A helper? Uh-huh. But the point of the decorator is to encapsulate logic just like we would a method in our models. Here's how to implement it.

First, follow the steps above to add the dependency and update your bundle.

Since we're talking about the `Article` model we'll create an `ArticleDecorator` class. You could do it by hand, but use the provided generator:

```
rails generate draper:decorator Article
```

Now open up the created `app/decorators/article_decorator.rb` and you'll find an `ArticleDecorator` class. Add this method:

```ruby
def published_at
  date = h.content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%A, %B %e").squeeze(" "), :class => 'date')
  time = h.content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%l:%M%p").delete(" "), :class => 'time')
  h.content_tag :span, date + time, :class => 'published_at'
end
```

Then you need to perform the wrapping in your controller. Here's the simplest method:

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @article = ArticleDecorator.find params[:id]
  end
end
```

Then within your views you can utilize both the normal data methods and your new presentation methods:

```ruby
<%= @article.published_at %>
```

Ta-da! Object-oriented data formatting for your view layer. Below is the complete decorator with extra comments removed:

```ruby
class ArticleDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :article
  
  def published_at
    date = h.content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%A, %B %e").squeeze(" "), :class => 'date')
    time = h.content_tag(:span, article.published_at.strftime("%l:%M%p"), :class => 'time').delete(" ")
    h.content_tag :span, date + time, :class => 'published_at'
  end
end
```

### Example of Decorated Associations

Add a `decorates_association :association_name` to gain access to a decorated version of your target association.

```ruby
class ArticleDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :article
  decorates_association :author # belongs_to :author association  
end

class AuthorDecorator < ApplicationDecorator
  decorates :author
  
  def fancy_name
    "#{model.title}. #{model.first_name} #{model.middle_name[0]}. #{model.last_name}"
  end
end
```

Now when you call the association it will use a decorator.

```ruby
<%= @article.author.fancy_name %>
```
